## 1. <ins>Introduction<ins>
   This test plan describes the strategies, process, workflows and methodologies used to plan, organize, execute and manage testing process for OrangeHRM browser application, ADMIN Module, Submenu: USER MANAGEMENT and JOB .
### 1.1 Project objective
   The scope of the final project for ITF Manual & Automation Testing Course is to use all gained knowledge through the course and apply them in practice using a live application. 
   
   [Application under test](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/admin/viewSystemUsers)
   
   [Application documentation](https://www.orangehrm.com/assets/Files/Complete-Administrative-User-Guide.pdf?url=/Files/Complete-Administrative-User-Guide.pdf 
)
   
   **Tools**: Jira, Postman, MySql
</br>  
   
### 1.2 Functionalities in scope
   All features of **Admin** ( Submenu:USER MANAGEMENT and JOB ) module which were defined in software requirement specification need to be: Functional testing, GUI testing, API testing.  
  
[User story 1.pdf](https://github.com/SimonaHunca/Proiect-practic-TM/files/12039489/User.story.1.pdf)


### 1.3 Functionalities and tests out of scope
  - All OrangeHRM features except SUBMENU from Admin menu : USER MANAGEMENT and JOB 
  - Non-functional testing like stress, performance is beyond scope of this project.
  - No QA support for mobile application developed. Only web application will be tested.
  - Automation testing is beyond scope.
## 2. <ins>Test Process<ins>
  ### 2.1 Test Planning 
   
#### Roles and responsabilities:
| **Role** | **Name** |
| :-------------: | :-------------:| 
| Software Developer | Maria Marinescu | 
| Product Owner | Alisa RÄƒdoi |
| Project Manager| Gabriela Radulescu |
| QA Engineer|   Simona Hunca |
| Senior QA Engineer | Rafael Popescu |
   
#### Entry criteria :
   - functional specification defined
   - roles needed for the project are allocated 
   - initial project risks were detected and mitigated
#### Exit criteria : 
   - all test cases have been executed
   - the number of unresolved bugs is insignificant or have low priority
   - all resolved bugs have been re-tested and closed by the QA team 
   - deadline was reached
   - no detected major risks remained un-mitigated 
   
#### Risks :
   ***Project risks***:
   - lack of experience of the QA team
   - only one QA in the QA team
   - unavalability of the test environment 
   - short deadline of Zephyr Squad and Jira tools
   
   ***Product risks***:
   - software security breaches the realease of confidential employee information
   
   
### 2.2 Test Analysis
   - analyze business requirements to make sure that we have all information for creating the test condition
   - write test conditions that will be tested out in test process
   
   ***Test Conditions:***
   
   1. Verify that all submenus in Admin Module are present
   2. Verify that Add User window has all the input fields and dropdowns available
   3. Verify that Job Menu has all the submenus available

### 2.3 Test Design
   - functional test cases will be created in Zephyr Squad 
   - GUI test cases will be created in Zephyr Squad
   - API test cases will be created in Postman 
   - the test design techniques used for generating test cases are: equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis. 


### 2.4 Test Implementation
   Verify that the following elements are ready before the test execution phase: 
   - test environment is up and running: [OrangeHRM Admin] (https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login) 
   - access to the test environment is given: username Admin, pass: admin123
   - cycle summary (*test cases colection from Jira) was created and the test cases were added to the cycle summary 
   - Postman collections were created 
   
### 2.5 Test Execution
   - test cases are executed on the created Cycle summary 
   - bug reports were created based on the failed test cases. 
   - API test cases were executed 
   - full regression tests pack was executed 

### 2.6 Test Completion
   As the exit criteria were met and satisfied as mentioned in the 2.1 section, this feature is suggested to go live by the QA team. 
   
### 2.7 Test Monitoring and Control   
   Generate periodic reports to check the project status: status for the test cases executed, status for the converge of the business requirements, etc
